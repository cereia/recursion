# recursion

Write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.
- Input of 8 should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
- write a method using iteration
- write a method using recurison

Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using recursive merge sort.
- Input of [3, 2, 1, 13, 8, 5, 0, 1] should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
- Input of [105, 79, 100, 110] should return [79, 100, 105, 110].
